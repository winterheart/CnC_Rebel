/**
** MaterialEffectClass
** This class is an abstract base class for any kind of "extra pass" material effect.  Phys objects
** support a list of these effects being added to them and will push and pop the effects during
** rendering.  For "transient" effects like shadows, the auto-remove flag can be enabled which
** will cause the physics object to un-link the effect after rendering is complete.
**
**  NOTES:
**
**  I need to abstract the differences between the stealth effect and things like texture projections
**  and shadows.  By clumping all of the stealth effect stuff into an external class, we'll be able
**  to apply it both to the character and any other models like his first person hands, etc.  By
**  unifying texture projectors and these new types of effects, we can just upgrade the list
**  that is already present in all PhysClass's.
**
**  This means that when shadows are linked onto render objects, they will need to be wrapped by
**  a class derived from this new abstract base class.  We'll probably want to recycle the wrappers
**  since shadows are re-attached every frame.  This also means that the wrapper needs an auto-remove
**  flag so the phys object can discard it after rendering is complete if necessary.
**
**  If we want to also use the stealth object for game logic, we need to ensure that its internal
**  variables update even when it doesn't get rendered.  The PhysClass could timestep all of the
**  currently attached material effects.  The only ones attached during timestep would be the
**  "persistant" ones...
