  Physics system

  All objects in the world which want to interact physically (as opposed to being
  simply decorations) will register a "PhysicalObject" with the physics sytem.
  The ABC PhysicalObjectClass is used by the physics manager for the following
  things:

  - checking for collisions between all objects; methods for collision detection
    will be pure virtual methods of the base class
  - computing forces between any "linked" objects
  - applying global gravity and damping to all of the objects
  - telling all physical objects to timestep themselves.

  Initializing the system

  - Physics system will init itself by clearing all of its lists and
    tables.

  - Each game object asks the physics system to create an instance of a
    physics object and specifies all of the important parameters...

  - Whenever an object is added to the system, it is added in sorted order
    to the x,y, and z "neighbor" lists.

  Each frame the following things will happen:

  - All game objects will exert their influence over their PhysicalObjects using
    methods provided.  Game objects will usually know exactly what PhysicalObject
         type they have.  I.e. a HummVee will know that its physical object is a
         Wheel4PhysClass and will be able to directly call methods of that class.

  - One at a time, each physical object will take its "move" for the frame.  Moves
    will be calculated in a framerate-independent way.  A single "move" for an object
         may consist of rotation and translation.

  Each move, the following things will happen:

  - The object will rotate in place according to its angular velocity and the
    amount of time which has passed for this frame

  - Collision detection code will "push" the object into a valid position in the world.
    If it is unable to push the object into a valid position, the rotation state will
         be reverted.

  - The object will then compute a translational move for the frame based on its
    velocity and the time which has passed.

  - Collision detection code will test the final position for penetration with the world.
    If penetration has occured, the object will be pushed out of the polygons it
         is penetrating.  If this is not possible, we revert to the previous state.

  Brainstorming:

  - Collision between any pair of objects can be disabled or enabled as desired?

  - Multiple different types of collision objects or everything is a box?
    Or everything is three different sets of 3d boxes?

  - A separate sorted list for the x axis, y axis and z axis will be maintained.  It
    will be used to optimize the collision detection algorithm.  A single, overall
         bounding sphere / axis aligned box should be used for this quick rejection.

  - How will all of the separate physical object types interact???  The papers all
    handle everything as a rigid body, no special cases...

  - Different types of objects need to interact whenever a collision occurs.  The
    physics manager should just detect collisions, then the objects should ask for
         any info they need to resolve the collision.  Whenever a value is computed for
         a particular collision, it should be cached so that if the second object also
         needs the same value, it is not re-computed.

  - "real" collision resolution requires the velocity of the collision point.

  - How do we generalize the dy/dt function for the ODE solver since we have multiple
    different types of objects (with different state vectors)
    * each object will be responsible for: (1) adding itself to the state vector
           (2) getting its new state out of the state vector and (3) adding its
                derivatives to the derivative vector.  Each of these functions will
                return the number of values which were added to the vector.  This should
                allow us to "dumb-down" the physics for objects which are far away too...

  - Can each object be asked for its dy/dt separately?
    * yes, each object will add its dy/dt values to a given array.

  - All of this copying into the gigantic state vector sounds really in-efficient.
    Find a better system.  What if we only decide to use Euler's method, it could
         be easily hard coded into each object type...
         * The giganitic state vector approach is overkill.  We will not use it.

12/03/97

  - Each object will be "timestepped" individually.  Each object type will be
    free to use whatever integration method it wants to (again, no monolithic state
         vector)

  - One at a time, each object will be told to update their state.  They will be
    given an elapsed time to ensure that we are frame-rate independent.

  - The steps a typical physical object will need to take in order to update itself:

         - Store its current state so that we can revert if we have to

         - Compute a desired state for the end of the timestep.  This can be done
           using the high-tech integrator and all of the rigid body dynamics equations.

    - Do the rotation portion of that move in place.

    - "Push" the object into a valid position (world polys and object polys)
           If push goes into an infinite loop, revert and kill the angular velocity.

    - Subdivide the linear move into steps which are ~half the characteristic
           length of the bounding box.  Store this vector

         - Loop while we haven't eaten the entire translation:

      - Add the sub-move vector

                - "Push" the object into a valid position, modify velocity by normal of the
                  polygon collided with.  If push goes into an infinite loop, revert to
                  previous sub-move and exit


Feb 9, 1998

        Nope, try again, simplify, simplify, simplify!

        - For objects which do not care about rotation causing collision (e.g. characters),
        *use a collision object which doesn't care either!*  So, for characters and many of the
        objects in the game, we will use either Axis-Aligned boxes or cylinders.  Since I have
        the math for casting an axis-aligned box, I will probably use that.  These objects will
        rotate within thier box so to the physics system, rotation / orientation will be trivial.

        - Jello Physics! For objects like the vehicles which were going to be done with rigid body
        dynamics I'm going to try a spring-mass model.  There are many problems with rigid body
        dynamics.  It is very difficult and expensive to compute correct contact forces, and it
        is difficult to find contact points.  Assuming the bodies are rigid requires collision
        detection or at least penetration depth calculations for solids like Oriented Boxes or
        Convex Polyhedra.  I have solved "volume-sweeping" for oriented boxes but not "volume-
        rotation" or the penetration depth calculation.  The spring mass model avoids these
        problems and it comes down to testing line-segments for intersection with the world
        polygons.

        - Each object will still be moved one at a time.  At the beginning of a move, an object
        must be in a valid position.  Its move will be "cast" through the world and the object
        will only actually move up to the first collision.  At that point, the velocity will be
        modified to slide along whatever it it (if possible).  Repeat until the entire move
        vector is eaten or the object is stopped completely.

April 14, 1998

  - Finally getting back to the physics system.  Month of march was spent converting code
  to the new version of surrender.  So, not all of the items in the February notes were
  implemented.  At this point, I have the beginnings of the character collision system.  It
  relies on the Cast_AABox function which sweeps an axis-aligned box through the world.
  currently it only checks for collisions with the terrain polygons.  Also, the "move-one-
  at-a-time" system was implemented and the old simulation style system removed.

  - I have hidden the implementation of the terrain collision from the game engine.  Any
  terrain implementation must simply support the Cast_Ray, Cast_AABox, Cast_OBBox functions
  and be able to give the user a pointer to a render object which can be added to the scene
  in which the terrain is to be rendered.  This should allow some freedom to experiment with
  octrees or bsp trees to speed up the cast functions...

  - The next step is to use the existing "partitioned" mesh to implement the rest of the
  needed collision detection functionality so that the rest of the team can work with it
  while I experiment with more efficient systems.
   - Cast_AABox must be made to also check against the objects.
        - Cast_Ray should be hooked in and a physics object for projectiles which is based on
          Cast_Ray should be created.
        - Communication system between the game engine and collision system should be tested.
     This is going to be a virtual class which simply defines a virtual callback method,
          game objects will multiply inherit this class and get messages from the system
          whenever a collision occurs.

June 1, 1998

  - Working on collision detection again.  Spent the past two weeks or so writing some
  bpt code which turns the terrain mesh into a combination bsp/box tree (I simply call it
  a Binary Partition Tree).  Each node contains a bounding box which bounds all polygons
  in the tree below that node.  Building an efficient bpt is becoming a priority since
  we're getting a lot of splits and also nodes with gobs of polys in them due to the
  way our terrains are constructed.  Should be easy to take advantage of our grid lines.

  - Collision system has been hooked into the game and a very simple projectile physics
  class written which uses rays instead of full blown boxes.  The collision system communicates
  back to the game through multiple inheritance of a "CollisionObserverClass".  The projectile
  physics work pretty well when you plug in RK4 or Midpoint as the integrator; same trajectory
  no matter what the framerate (within reason). (Mar2000 note: this was pretty stupid since you can
  directly calculate where the projectile would end up if the only force is gravity!)

  - Changing all of the internal collision functions to pass around "collision test classes"
  which wrap the primitive, its movement vector, a results structure, and any pre-calculatable
  variables into one structure.  The main reason for this was just so I have a place to put
  the info that can be precalculated and re-used.  (e.g. put a min,max along with the AABoxClass)

  - Now writing the recursive AABox Cast function which casts the box against the bpt.  Once
  this is in place, we should start getting a significant speedup from using the bpt.

  - Thinking again about using a hybrid between the "every object moves on its own" and
  the "every object puts itself into the monolithic state vector" ideas.  I do need some objects
  to be simulated together if we want to completely avoid being tied to fixed timesteps.  For
  example, I need to simulate the camera along with the object its tied to...  If we do true
  contact... all things touching each other will need to be simulated together.

July 13, 1998

  - Removing the distinction between physical objects and terrain.  New engine idea will use
  a combination of a heightfield and tilemap.  This means we're going to have multiple "terrains"
  and we will also be having meshes which don't move but are collideable such as guard towers, etc.

August 31, 1998

  CURRENT SITUATION: several sub-systems need efficient culling:
  - rendering system needs to be able to only render objects which are in the view frustum
  - collision system needs to quickly narrow down the number of objects checked for each
    collision query made.
  - AI/Game Logic needs to be able to quickly find "nearby" objects, objects within certain
    radii, objects which are in a given cone etc...

  PROBLEMS:
  - current code has no culling except for the TileMap object which is itself a huge render
    object spanning the entire level that performs culling internally in its render call.
  - currently, the "SceneClass" is expected to only deal with RenderObj derived classes.
  - collision queries and the like must go through physics object interfaces so that some
    physics objects can use simple primitives
  - deriving physobj from renderobj doesn't make a lot of sense because render obj is a
    relatively "heavy" class.  I don't want to make another wrapper (and have the associated
         duplicated transforms, etc...)
  - Render objects can have their transforms changed at the programmers whim, there is
    no built-in provision for telling the scene to refresh its culling information

  SOLUTION:
  - make a physics "SceneClass" with culling datastructures for both static and dynamic culling
  - physics scene deals only with physics objects
  - therefore all objects in the "game world" will be represented by a physics object
  - when a physics object changes position, the culling database can be refreshed
  - physobj needs its linkage information built in.

        class PhysicsSceneClass : public SceneClass
        {
                void Add_Render_Obj(...)		{ assert(0); }
                void Remove_Render_Obj(...)	{ assert(0); }

                void Add_Physical_Object(PhysObjClass * pobj,hint = MOVING);
                void Remove_Physical_Object(PhysObjClass * pobj);

                void Render(CameraClass & cam);
                bool Cast_Ray( );
                bool Cast_AABox( );
                bool Cast_OBBox( );
                PhysObjListClass * Get_Spatial_Object_List(pos,radius);
                PhysObjListClass * Get_Spatial_Object_List(min,max);
                PhysObjListClass * Get_Spatial_Object_List(frustum);
                PhysObjListClass * Get_Spatial_Object_List(raytest);
                PhysObjListClass * Get_Spatial_Object_List(raytest);
        }

September 15, 1998

  Finished my work on the initial prototype of the level editor.  In the process of writing the
  level editor, I implemented the new PhysicsSceneClass which replaces the old classes: PhysicsSystem
  PrivatePhysicsSystem and CollisionSystem and also takes over the job of the main 3D game scene
  for rendering.  This caused some major re-organization and as a result most of WWPhys was #if 0'd...

  A new base class PhysClass was implemented along with a derived DecorationPhysClass which can
  be inserted into this scene and rendered, collided with, etc.  The AABTree culling system for
  all of the static meshes was written to be dynamically re-partitionable.  The Grid culling system
  was only implemented in terms of an interface.  Currently it just contains a linked list of
  PhysClasses.

  Next job is to add all of the functionality of the old system (Phys4, CharPhys, Tilemap, etc) into
  this system and get Commando running on top of it.

  NOTES:
  - New system contains provisions for updating the culling datastructures when an object moves.
    I should also add a "safe teleport" function which asks the system if it is ok for an object
         to be in a given position and if not, move the object to a safe position.  This could get
         rid of the possibility of "startbad's" on level load.

  - TileMapClass is now obsolete but much of its functionality will have to go into game code.
    The PhysicsSceneClass contains an axis-aligned bounding box tree which serves the purpose
         that TileMap used to.  Other "TerrainPhysClass's" are still going to be single objects though.

November 30, 1998

  Just completed another massive port to the latest version of surrender (1.4x).  Also had to
  rewrite much of the plugin this time.

  Adding occlusion culling for all physics objects in the "static" scene.  I still have some
  questions in my mind as to how this is going to work but the basic idea is that there will
  be "vis-sectors".  Each vis-sector will contain a bit-vector with one bit for every piece of
  static geometry which indicates whether that piece of geometry can be seen from this
  "vis-sector".  These bit arrays will be created by rendering the scene from each sector
  in a way that writes the node's id rather than texturing, lighting, etc, and then reading
  the framebuffer to see which nodes were not occluded.  Currently I have two questions:
  How are these vis sectors defined? and How can I cull dynamic objects using this information?

  Now working on the occlusion bit vectors.  Currently implementing it with a full bit vector for
  each object which contains a bit for every other object.  If we compress this, we could at
  the start of each frame, decompress the vis bits for the current active node (or even only
  decompress it when the active node changes).  Only problem is in implementation, editor stuff
  will want an uncompressed one that is easily modified; game will want tight compressed vis table.

December 21, 1998

  Converted W3D to render directly to the gerd (bypass the sr scene graph).  This was the
  easiest way to implement the vis-detection stuff and opens the door for us to
  hierarchically cull lights.  Vis detection is implemented now.

  Need to implement a file format for the map.

  - What is in the file format?
  - Who reads/writes it?
  - If pscene just loads stuff directly, how does Byon get ahold of the objects?
  - VisBits are independent of culling system!  They only depend on the IDs not changing!
  - Its a lot simpler if this system *only* contains completely static meshes! (not walls, etc)
         + none of them *need* game logic
         + none of them change or move
         + byon doesn't need a game object wrapped around them
         - is there no pre-calculated lighting on the non static stuff?
         - want as much as we can get into this since it should be faster and has no size restrictions

  File format is going to be chunk based.  Parsing of the top-levels of the file will occur
  in Commando.  Certain chunks will be passed down to the PhysicsSceneClass to be handled.
  These chunks will include a chunk which wraps all of the culling data, a chunk which wraps
  each static object or dynamic object, chunks for zones and lights, etc.

Jan 15, 1999

  Working on the lighting management system.  For the static lights in the level, I want
  to use an efficient culling system like the AABTree.  All of these lights will be entered
  into the scene through a custom call in the physics scene.  All dynamic lights will be
  added through the normal Add_Render_Object function or by being added as sub-objects
  of a model in the scene.

  Add_Render_Obj and Remove_Render_Obj will be implemented by having the physics scene
  automatically create a cullable object for the render object and storing the pointer
  to that object in the UserData field.  In addition, the cullable object created for them
  will need to be a "dirty culler" that assumes its bounding box or transform could change
  at any time since the user is obviously working with a render object and could change
  the transform underneath us (normally this is a no-no).  These will be added to a "dirty
  culler" list and caused to re-insert themselves into the dynamic culling system each
  frame.  These objects will never cause collisions either (just for sanity) they
  are only visual...

  Render function will look like this:

  Render() {

                update the "dirty cullers"
                collect dynamic objects and vertex processors (dy_obj_list,dy_vp_list)
                push dynamic vertex processors
                render static terrain

                global optimization of LOD levels for the dynamic objects

                for each dynamic object
                        push static lights which may affect it
                        render
                        pop static lights that were pushed

                pop dynamic vertex processors

May 27, 1999

  Moving the Visibility system into PhysicsSceneClass so that it can incorporate
  pre-calculated visibility for other things like dynamic objects.  Previously it
  was pretty nicely encapsulated inside of the static culling system.

October 26, 1999

        Adding shadow generation code

Jan 2000

        Pluging in the decal system, texture projection system is mostly done except for
        optimizations and static projector generation (masses of tree shadows and stuff).

Feb 21, 2000

  Decals are done, Animated Static objects with collision are working now (translation
  only).  Adding code which generates the static projectors (tree shadows, window projections
  and things like that).  Optimized the view-frustum culling code to propogate the plane
  masks and perform trivial acceptance of entire sub-trees.

Junk 28, 1000

  Major VIS update.  Now the dynamic culling system is a pre-generated AABTree with
  precalculated visiblity for each node in the tree.  In addition, the static object
  culling system contains hierarchical visibility data and each light will have a
  pvs for what static objects and dynamic object cells it can "see".  The generation
  of the dynamic object AAB-Tree is "seeded" with a pathfind solve and a coarse
  voxelization of the level.  This tree is "optimized" after VIS is computed; redundant
  leaves of the tree are deleted and the vis tables collapsed.

Aug 9, 2000

  Implementing a new lighting system which collects the lights affecting each object
  which is not pre-lit and creates temporary directional lights for them.  This should
  solve the problem of having a level with thousands of lights but only a few that
  actually need to be active.  We'll still need to reduce the number of lights in
  some levels though.  The code for this lighting algorithm can be found in
  lightenvironment.cpp.

Sept 24, 2000

        Making the lighting system coherent across frames.  If an object doesn't move, it
        will have its local static lighting environment cached and can just re-use the data.
        Whenever physics object move, they invalidate their internal cache and will ask
        the physics scene to recompute the lighting environment next time its needed.  This
        change involved adding the Compute_Static_Lighting function to pscene and the
        pair of functions: Invalidate_Static_Lighting_Cache and Get_Static_Lighting_Cache
        to PhysClass.  These caches must also be invalidated when lights in the scene change
        state (such as when the power goes out in a building...)

April 2001

        Installed the new vis renderer, it seems to simplify a lot of code!  Also converting
        the shadow rendering code to work under DX8.  I plan to add a new shadow mode which
        uses hardware to render-to-texture.
