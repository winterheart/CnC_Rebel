**	This engine will process data blocks by encryption and decryption.
**	The "Blowfish" algorithm is in the public domain. It uses
**	a Feistal network (similar to IDEA). It has no known
**	weaknesses, but is still relatively new. Blowfish is particularly strong
**	against brute force attacks. It is also quite strong against linear and
**	differential cryptanalysis. Unlike public key encription, it is very
**	fast at encryption, as far as cryptography goes. Its weakness is that
**	it takes a relatively long time to set up with a new key (1/100th of
**	a second on a P6-200). The time to set up a key is equivalent to
**	encrypting 4240 bytes.
