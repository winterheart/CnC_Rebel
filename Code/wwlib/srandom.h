//	SecureRandomClass - Generate random values that are suitable for use in cryptographic
//		applications (under UNIX at least).
//
//	NOTE: The seed generation under windows isn't nearly as strong as under UNIX due to
//		the lack of /dev/random.  If you have a good random source you can call 'Add_Seeds'
//		to improve the quality of the seed value.
//
// Currently the random seed generation under windows is piss-poor so make sure and call
//		Add_Seeds with some interesting data if you're going to use this!
//
//	The seed values should be unguessable by an outside viewer and the random values have
//		good distribution properties.
