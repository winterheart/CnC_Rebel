**	This class manages the "mouse cursor". It presumes the mouse behaves in the traditional

**
**	The mouse interface is designed with the following requirements:
**
**	1> The interface (coordinate system) must be consistent with respect to the game user.
**		This means that coordinate 0,0 is the upper left pixel of the drawable client area.
**
**	2> It must support arbitrary mouse cursor artwork size and hotspot positioning. Mouse shape
**		animation should be a simple process of just changing the mouse shape.
**
**	3> The mouse must be able to break free of the game constraints where necessary in order
**		to interface with the operating system. The transition should be easy to manage.
**
**	4> The game mouse "active" region may be a subset rectangle of the normal visible surface.
**		This bounding requirement should be transparent to system's functionality.
**
**	The system assumes that the sub-rectangle that binds the mouse to the visible surface will
**	exactly match the dimensions of any hidden surface that the mouse may have occasion to be
**	drawn upon.
