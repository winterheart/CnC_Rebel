// RC4.h - Implementation of RC4 encryption
//
//	RC4 is a stream cypher.  This means that it basically produces a stream of
//		random bytes that you XOR with your data.  Each key is somewhat like a
//		one time pad.
//
//	Just as you should never re-use a one time pad, you should never re-use a key.
//
//	If you can't re-exchange a secret key before every message you could keep a
//		partial secret key and then include the other part of the key in plaintext.
//		The key would be the concatenation of the two parts of the key.
//

class RC4Class {
public:
  RC4Class();

  //
  // Key length can be 0..256 bytes
  // Key preparation takes about 0.015 Ms on a 1Ghz PC
  //
  void Prepare_Key(const unsigned char *key_data_ptr, int key_data_len);

  //
  // In-place encryption.  Call Prepare_Key first!
  // Only a few clock cycles per byte (9 or so...)
  //
