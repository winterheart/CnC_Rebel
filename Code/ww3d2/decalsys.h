** 1 - Create the generator.  The system gives it a unique id and gives you a clean decal generator
**
** DecalGeneratorClass * gen = DecalSystem->Lock_Decal_Generator();
** gen->Set_Transform(tm);
** gen->Set_Projection(proj_tm);
** gen->Set_Bounds(OBBox);
**
** 2 - Apply the generator to any objects that you want it to affect.  It wont do anything if it
**     does not overlap any polygons in those objects
**
** Scene->Collect_Objects(gen->Get_Bounding_Box(),objectlist);
** for (iterator.First(objectlist); !iterator.Is_Done(); iterator.Next()) {
**   iterator.Peek_Object()->Create_Decal(gen);
** }
**
** 3 - Release the generator back to the system.  At this point, the system may record which meshes
**     actually generated extra decal polygons for future removal.  All of this information will be
**     tied together with the unique 'decal ID' that was assigned to the generator.
