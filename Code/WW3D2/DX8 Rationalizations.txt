This document is going to be a place to put descriptions of our reasoning for any "confusing" design decisions made during the conversion to DX8.

TODO: WRITE PROPER DESCRIPTIONS FOR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING!!!

Lighting
--------
The user has two choices regarding lighting.  SimpleSceneClass will just install the first four LightClasses
into DX8 and let them affect all objects.  Otherwise, you need to implement a SceneClass which wraps each
top-level render object and associates a LightEnvironmentClass with it.  In your 'Customized_Render' function
you need to update each object's LightEnvironment object from the lights around it.

Mesh Rendering System
---------------------
Grouped by FVF format and material settings.  Many meshes can share a single VB and IB...

MeshModel Sharing
-----------------
It would be nice if MeshClass just Add_Ref'd the same mesh model whenever we re-use a mesh.  The problems with 
this are:
- the transform which is used during deffered rendering and during decal rendering
- instance specific light environment pointer is in the mesh model class
- lots of other stuff <-- FILL THIS IN!
