  LEV File Format.

  This is another chunk-based file format which will initially describe the map for
  a commando level and may eventually expand to include the description of the entire
  level.  Due to the structure of our code, this file format will define several
  "wrapper" chunks whose contents are defined in another header file in the physics
  library (physchunks.h).  Game code will make calls to the physics library when it
  encounters those chunks.

  The chunk 'LEV_CHUNK_STATIC_SCENE' can be handled by the physics scene's Load_Static_Scene
  function and the 'LEV_CHUNK_DYNAMIC_SCENE' can be handled by the physics scene's 
  Load_Dynamic_Scene function.  The definitions for the data inside those chunks can be
  found inside the header file 'physchunks.h'
